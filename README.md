# VESC (Benjamin Vedders ESC) library for ESP8266 and Arduino

This library is a small and clean implementation to control the [VESC](TODO) via serial connection on the ESP8266 or Arduino platform. It provides multiple methods to control your motor. Addionally you can get a lot of useful status information from the VESC (current, RPM, amp hours, temperatures).

The library is completely new implemented, but was inspired by the following projects:
- [VescUartControl](TODO)
- [bldc_uart_comm_stm32f4_discovery](TODO)
