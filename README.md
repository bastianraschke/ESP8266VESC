# VESC (Benjamin Vedders ESC) library for ESP8266 and Arduino

This library is a small and clean implementation to control the [VESC](http://vedder.se/2015/01/vesc-open-source-esc/) via serial connection on the ESP8266 or Arduino platform. It provides multiple methods to control your motor. Addionally you can get a lot of useful status information from the VESC (current, RPM, amp hours, temperatures).

The library is completely new implemented, but was inspired by the following projects:

- [VescUartControl](https://github.com/RollingGecko/VescUartControl)
- [bldc_uart_comm_stm32f4_discovery](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc_uart_comm_stm32f4_discovery)

Additionally [this page](http://vedder.se/2015/10/communicating-with-the-vesc-using-uart/) was helpful.
